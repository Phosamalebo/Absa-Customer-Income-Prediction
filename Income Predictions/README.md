# General Info
This project is part of a machine learning challenge aiming to determine a customer's income based on their transaction history over a 14-month period. The primary objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts the declared net income of customers using the provided data.

#Technologies used

The project leverages the following technologies and libraries:

Python

pandas

scikit-learn

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook (for data exploration and model development)

SAS(for data visualisation)

## Features

The dataset includes the following features:

    CUSTOMER_IDENTIFIER: Unique identifier for each customer
    
    DATE_LAST_UPDATED: Date of the last update for customer information
    
    SEX_CODE: Customer's gender code
    
    INCOME_GROUP_CODE: Income group code to which the customer belongs
    
    NUMBER_OF_ACCOUNTS: Number of accounts associated with the customer
    
    OCCUPATIONAL_STATUS_CODE: Code representing customer's occupational status
    
    AGE: Age of the customer
    
    TRANSACTION_DESCRIPTION: Description of the customer transaction
    
    TRANSACTION_RECORD_DATE: Date of the customer transaction
    
## Setup

To set up the customer Income prediction project , follow these steps:

Install the required software and libraries for Python and SAS. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

Import the dataset into SAS and Python Then perform analysis with SAS and do machine learning with python.

## Usage

## Project status

This project is currently in development.
